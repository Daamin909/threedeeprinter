# threedeeprinter - a custom 3D printer

### 28th May (day 1): initial research

i did some talking to people on Slack (@aryan, @souptik, @manan) and learnt quite a bit about how 3D printer work. i checked out some articles and videos on that topic.

I decided on a few basic things:-

- printer material
- kinematics
- build volume
- other VERY cool features

**Total time spent:** 1.5 hours

### 29th May (day 2): more research and beginning work on Gantry

i checked the [infill](https://infill.hackclub.com) resources and docs, and looked at other very cool printers built by HC members. in the end, I decided to take one of the printers as my inspiration. i read an [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-3D-Printer-From-Scratch/) article and began my work on the Gantry/frame.

i started with the base 4040 and 2040 extrusions.
